Description: The goal of 'surveynnet' is to extend the functionality of 'nnet', 
  which already supports survey weights, by enabling it to handle clustered
  and stratified data. It achieves this by incorporating design effects 
  through the use of effective sample sizes as outlined by Chen
  and Rust (2017), <doi:10.1093/jssam/smw036>, and performed by  
  'deffCR' in the package 'PracTools' (Valliant, Dever, and Kreuter (2018), 
  <doi:10.1007/978-3-319-93632-1>).
